## Structure

We evaluated [Fuzzilli](https://github.com/googleprojectzero/fuzzilli) and [Superion](https://github.com/zhunki/Superion) and compared their code coverage in general and concerning JIT compiler related code in particular.

This repository contains the related artifacts for reproducability.

If there are any questions feel free to contact us.
