## Structure

We evaluated [Fuzzilli](https://github.com/googleprojectzero/fuzzilli) and [Superion](https://github.com/zhunki/Superion) and compared their code coverage in general and concerning JIT compiler related code in particular. As Superion requires an input corpus we opted to use the open dataset provided by DIE. Our artifacts concerning intial coverage and a reduced input corpus is [here](https://github.com/evaluating-fuzzilli-for-js-jit-fuzzing/SuperionInputCorpus).

This org contains the artifacts required for reproducability, i.e., the input corpus we used for Superion.

If there are any questions feel free to contact us.
